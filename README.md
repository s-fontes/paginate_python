# paginate_python
Class for searching, sorting and paging an ORM SQLAlchemy query

Looking for a way to paginate an ORM query in python and not finding it, I decided to build a class to do that.
This class aims to be a simple way to filter, sort and paginate a query so that it can be used in a REST API response.
